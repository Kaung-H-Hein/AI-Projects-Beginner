# AI-Projects-Beginner
This repository showcases a collection of beginner-level AI projects developed during my AI module in my bachelor's degree. Each project is implemented in Python and explores fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence, including machine learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modelling. The projects aim to demonstrate practical applications of AI techniques while highlighting my early journey into the field.

### 1. Chatbot ROBO
- Chatbot_ROBO.ipynb
- This project is a simple rule-based chatbot named ROBO, designed to answer user queries about chatbots. It uses TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity to generate context-based responses from a provided text corpus. The chatbot can recognise greetings, respond interactively, and handle basic conversations. Built with Python, it leverages libraries like NLTK for preprocessing (tokenisation, lemmatisation) and scikit-learn for text vectorisation.
