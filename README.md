# AI-Projects-Beginner
This repository showcases a collection of beginner-level AI projects developed during my AI module in my bachelor's degree. Each project is implemented in Python and explores fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence, including machine learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modelling. The projects aim to demonstrate practical applications of AI techniques while highlighting my early journey into the field.

## Table of contents

### 1. Calories Burnt Prediction 
- CaloriesBurntPrediction.ipynb
- This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict calories burnt based on user-specific features, such as Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration of activity, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature. Using Python, the data is analysed and visualised with pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, followed by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. An XGBoost Regressor is implemented for regression, and model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error.

### 2. Chatbot ROBO
- Chatbot_ROBO.ipynb
- This project is a simple rule-based chatbot named ROBO, designed to answer user queries about chatbots. It uses TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity to generate context-based responses from a provided text corpus. The chatbot can recognise greetings, respond interactively, and handle basic conversations. Built with Python, it leverages libraries like NLTK for preprocessing (tokenisation, lemmatisation) and scikit-learn for text vectorisation.
